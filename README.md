What Exactly Does This Project Do?
Have you ever looked at a bank statement and seen a confusing transaction like PAYTM*UBER INDIA SYSTEMS PV GURGAON? It's hard to tell what it was for at a glance.

This project solves that exact problem. It acts as a "Transaction Translator".

You give it the messy description, and it uses a machine learning model to instantly tell you two simple things:

What you bought (The Category): e.g., "Travel"

Where you bought it from (The Merchant): e.g., "Uber"

This turns confusing financial data into clean, human-readable information, improving the customer experience for any digital payment service.
